## Dataset

The dataset has 113,937 rows and 81 columns, but after wrangling we were left with 31 variables. one of the major findings is that high earners, best risk score, and others hardly comply in completely paying their loans, but majority of the payment are done majorly by the lower earners and so follow thus in others variables.
Finally, we can conclude that prosper compliance to payment increases and the graph is positive.


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I find out that LoanStatus variable, which as the records of compliance to loan payment, as a strong relationship with incomeRange, EstimatedReturn, ProsperScore, and other variables i use in my visualization, where it shows that majority of the completed payment where done by the low income earners, those who has low estimated return in their business, and a worst risk assessment. That is majority of the high earners do not comply. Secondly the relationship of payment of loan compliance as a positive trend. Lastly majority of variables have to be drop because they contain alot of empty cells, and have no direct usage for my analysis.
